\section{General Infromation}
The current representation of the (double) Round Robin tournament: ${MD \in \rm I\!B}^{nt\: x\: nd\: x\: nt}$

If compact scheme:
\[\large nt > 1 \]
\[\large nd = (nt-1) * 2\: if\: nt \:\% \:2 = 0\]
\[\large nd = nt * 2\: if\: nt \:\% \:2 = 1\]

\section{Used operators}
\[\large SumHomerow(d,t)\:= \sum_i MD[d][t][i]\]
\[\large SumAwayrow(d,t)\:= \sum_i MD[d][i][t]\]
\[\large SumRounds(h,a)\:= \sum_i MD[i][h][a]\]e
